# Anti-AI: AI Plagiarism Detection Tool

## Overview

Anti-AI is an interactive web application designed to analyze and determine the likelihood of text being generated by AI models. Utilizing the GPT-2 model from OpenAI, this tool calculates key metrics such as perplexity and burstiness to provide insights into the nature of the content. It also visualizes the most repeated words in the text, offering a comprehensive view of the text's characteristics.

The tool is built with Streamlit for the frontend interface and leverages popular Python libraries such as PyTorch, NLTK, and Plotly for the backend processing and visualization.

## Features

- Perplexity Calculation: Measures how well the language model can predict the text, indicating the likelihood of it being AI-generated.
- Burstiness Calculation: Analyzes the repetition of words to distinguish between human and AI-generated content.
- Top Repeated Words Visualization: Displays a bar chart of the top 10 most repeated words in the text.
- Interactive Text Input: Users can enter text directly and get real-time analysis and feedback.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Virtual environment setup (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download NLTK Data:
   Run the following in a Python shell or script to download necessary NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

5. Run the Application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Application:
   Launch the application using the command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Enter Text:
   Input your text into the text area provided in the web interface.

3. Analyze Text:
   Click on the "Analyze" button to compute and display the perplexity and burstiness scores along with a bar chart of the top repeated words.

4. Interpret Results:
   - Perplexity Score: A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of the text being AI-generated.
   - Burstiness Score: A lower score suggests less repetition typical of human writing.
   - The result section will provide an analysis of whether the text is likely AI-generated or human-generated.

5. View Visualization:
   A bar chart will display the top 10 most repeated words in the text for further insight.

## Dependencies

- Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
